# I Developed FeedbackApp.id (BETA), Here is What, Why

## TLDR
1. I developed FeedbackApp [https://feedbackapp.id](https://feedbackapp.id). It currently is beta.
2. Cost-efficient to be accessible for individual and small business.

## What is FeedbackApp.id?
FeedbackApp.id is a super simple and straight forward app to build the feedback form and ask feedback to 
your respondents.

It is designed to be so simple, so you can design your form in less than **10 minutes** and start collecting
feedback from your respondents. 

**Focus on collecting the feedback, not designing the form.**

## Why do I develop FeedbackApp.id?
Personally, I do it to challenge myself to build a product from scratch.

I have been working as a software engineer since 2010, in that span of years, I feel my soft skill side has
improved a lot and I did it by 
collecting feedback from my peers, my boss, and my team. **"What I can do better?"** is the question that I always ask.

After collecting the feedback, I compiled it to find out what mostly mentioned
and made a plan & goal to improve myself. 
I feel that this is a very cumbersome process. **Why not create a software to automate it?** I'm a software engineer 
after all.

## Why "re-invent the wheel"?
There is already open source software to build a feedback form.
There are already ready-to-use feedback form services.
There are already business map places services that provide reviews. 

Why reinvent the wheel? 

This is the question I asked myself before I decided to build FeedbackApp.id.

### History
Around 2014, one of the clients asked me to build a feedback form for their business processes. I solved it
by using existing Open Source software. It's working even though the process to set up the form is a long process, and
I personally feel the client asked too many questions to the respondents which made them reluctant to fill the form.

Around 2023, I was eating in the restaurant and I saw they asking for feedback via scanning QR code.
I thought this is a good idea and great that always looking a way to improve their service via feedback. 
I took the photo and planned to give feedback at back home. 

ALAS! how surprised I was when I found out the first question asked is "In which restaurant you eat?" 

And there are like 20 options in there. I closed the form. Sorry.

At that moment, I convinced myself that I want to build FeedbackApp.id with these principles:

### 1. Simplicity
The app must be as simple as possible both for the form designer and the respondent.

If it is not simple for the form designer, they will not use it.
If it is not simple for the respondent, they will not fill it.

### 2. Anonymity
**The best feedback is the honest feedback**. The respondent might feel uneasy to give feedback if 
we're asking who they are. Thus, why I designed it to be anonymous by default, if the respondent wants to give their
credentials, they can always do it via the form message, but it's not mandatory.

### 3. Cost-efficient
I want to make it accessible for individual and small business. Thus, I designed it to be cost-efficient. As long
as it covers the server operational cost and helps you improve yourselves or your business, I'm happy.

### 4. Continuity
Self-improvement is a continuous process. When we asked for feedback, compiled it, and made a plan to improve. Then on
next iteration we asked again for feedback, see if it works, and repeat the process.

## What's next?
I plan to write on how I architecture and develop FeedbackApp.id. Stay tuned!
